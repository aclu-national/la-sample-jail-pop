# Louisiana Sample Jail Population
In this repository, we present the results of scraping jail population data from the "LA VINE" system, a precursor to the Louisiana Automated Victim Notification System, "LAVNS" service. LA VINE has a feature called “ROSTERS”, wherein each roster "provides each jail with a 'live' roster updated every 30 minutes." These rosters are published (here)[https://lcle.la.gov/programs/lavine/lavine_rosters/]. To build the dataset we scraped the data for all of the live rosters and removed all identifiable information. 

## Note 
1. We have **not** included the code necessary to scrape the rosters from the LA VINE system to protect the privacy of those who jailed in Louisiana.
2. There are only 69 jails with live rosters. According to the [Vera Institute](https://www.vera.org/louisiana-locked-up), sheriff's operate 85 Parish jails and municipal police departments operate 65 jails. This means that this data set only accounts for 65% of all jails in Louisiana.
